This repository contains PresentPal, an Android application that will enable users to keep track of gifts and their recipients. The user will be able to enter a recipient, then add/remove gifts as needed. They can also add in holidays so they know which holiday to buy each gift for. The user can then sort their list by recipient or by holiday. The app will display the number of gifts and total price for each recipient or holiday, depending on how it is sorted.
